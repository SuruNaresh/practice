Git - Version control tool or software - Distributed version control
Azure Repo Git, Github, Gitlab - to store our source code

git having repositories
---------------------------
local repositories - in our machine
remote repositories - in remote location accessible via url

to run any git commands we can run only in git repository not outside of it. only git init you can run from any where

git init --> Initialize a repository

branches - copy of code on which we want to make changes
commits - each changes you make it could be single file or multiple files 

adding new files
U (green) - untracked
A (green) - Index added
M (yellow) - modified
D (red) - deleted
R (green) - Index renamed

git add <<file name/file path>> -- it will only add those
git add . --> it will take all newly created files
git commit -a --> to review and commit it 
git push --> we can use this directly if remote repo is also having same branches
git push --set-upstream origin <<branch name>> --> if branch is not exisiting in remote repository

modifying files
git commit -a 
git commit -a -m "<<provide commit message>>"
git commit -am "<<provide commit message>>"
git push --> we can use this directly if remote repo is also having same branches
git push --set-upstream origin <<branch name>> --> if branch is not exisiting in remote repository


deleting it
delete the file
git commit -am "<<provide commit message>>"
git push --> we can use this directly if remote repo is also having same branches
git push --set-upstream origin <<branch name>> --> if branch is not exisiting in remote repository



modifying exisitng files
adding new files
deleting it

changing branches
git switch branch name --> helps only to switch the branches
git checkout branch name --> helps to switch and also create new branches in local


git status
git log
git branch
git branch -r
git branch --all

git fetch
git pull = git fetch + git merge

branch policies
1. minimum reviewers
2. linked work items
3. comment resolution
4. limit merge types
5. build validation
