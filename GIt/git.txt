branches - copy of code on which we want to make changes
commits - each changes you make it could be single file or multiple files 

adding new files
U (green) - untracked

git add <<file name/file path>> -- it will only add those
git add . --> it will take all newly created files
git commit -a --> to review and commit it 
git push --> we can use this directly if remote repo is also having same branches
